<h3>If people are stuck inside</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Don&rsquo;t try to save them by opening the door.</li>
    <li>Reassure them. Let them know that help is on the way.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Ask them if anyone is injured or if anyone needs special assistance (for example, people
        with claustrophobia) and find out how many people are stuck in the elevator. &nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>Contact Security at extension 55 (internal phone system).</li>
    <li>Stay on site until help arrives. Continue to reassure people.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h4>If a person&rsquo;s condition worsens, inform Security.<br/>
    If you can&rsquo;t reach Security, dial 911.</h4>
