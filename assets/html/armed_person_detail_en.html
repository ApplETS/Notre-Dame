<h3>If you can leave the premises without putting yourself in danger, evacuate the building</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Remain calm.</li>
    <li>Never try to stop an armed person.</li>
    <li>Do not activate the fire alarm.</li>
    <li>Take the nearest emergency exit.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Use the stairs to exit the building. Don&rsquo;t take the elevator.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Show your hands so that police officers don&rsquo;t see you as a threat.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Inform anyone you meet that they should leave the premises immediately.</li>
    <li>Once you leave the building, don&rsquo;t stay in close range. Go to the meeting point that
        is a little further away, at the corner of Peel and St. Jacques Streets (the space in front
        of the old Planetarium).&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>Once you&rsquo;ve reached safety, call 911.</li>
</ul>

<h3>If you cannot safely leave the premises without putting yourself in danger, hide</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Stay calm and silent.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Hide and tell other people to do the same.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Lock the door of the room where you&rsquo;re hiding.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Barricade the door with furniture.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Close the blinds on the windows.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Stay away from doors and windows (hallways and outdoor walls).</li>
    <li>If there is a window that looks out on an external wall of the building, let police know you
        are there by putting a note in the window.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>Hide under a desk.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Stay quiet.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Put your cell phone in silent mode.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>If someone knocks at the door, don&rsquo;t open it. The person who is knocking may pose a
        threat to you.
    </li>
    <li>In the event that police officers need to check the premises, they will receive access cards
        and sets of keys.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>Never jump out of your hiding place, and keep your hands in plain sight.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Wait for directions from police officers or the Security and Prevention Office before
        leaving the premises.&nbsp;
    </li>
</ul>
