## If you can leave the premises without putting yourself in danger, evacuate the building

- Remain calm.
- Never try to stop an armed person.
- Do not activate the fire alarm.
- Take the nearest emergency exit.
- Use the stairs to exit the building. Don’t take the elevator.
- Show your hands so that police officers don’t see you as a threat.
- Inform anyone you meet that they should leave the premises immediately.
- Once you leave the building, don’t stay in close range. Go to the meeting point that is a little further away, at the corner of Peel and St. Jacques Streets (the space in front of the old Planetarium).
- Once you’ve reached safety, call 911.

## If you cannot safely leave the premises without putting yourself in danger, hide

- Stay calm and silent.
- Hide and tell other people to do the same.
- Lock the door of the room where you’re hiding.
- Barricade the door with furniture.
- Close the blinds on the windows.
- Stay away from doors and windows (hallways and outdoor walls).
- If there is a window that looks out on an external wall of the building, let police know you are there by putting a note in the window.
- Hide under a desk.
- Stay quiet.
- Put your cell phone in silent mode.
- If someone knocks at the door, don’t open it. The person who is knocking may pose a threat to you.
- In the event that police officers need to check the premises, they will receive access cards and sets of keys.
- Never jump out of your hiding place, and keep your hands in plain sight.
- Wait for directions from police officers or the Security and Prevention Office before leaving the premises.
