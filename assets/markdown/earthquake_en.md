- **Get down**: As soon as you feel the first tremors, your first reflex should be to crouch down on the floor to avoid falling.
- **Seek shelter**: As soon as you have crouched down, locate and move to a place where you can shelter yourself, such as underneath your desk or work table.
- **Hang on**: As soon as you are under your shelter, hang on tightly to the desk or table and remain there until the earthquake is over.
- Once the tremors have ended, remain under your shelter.
- Security will make an announcement by voice message that is appropriate for your area.
